This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run this project locally ,try one of these options:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
This will run the development server. 

Too see it, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your favourite browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.client.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
